<p style="text-align:center font-size:30px"> Kedarnath Temple is a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva.<br> 
  One of the most interesting features of the Kedarnath Temple is its unique lingam.<br>
  The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range near the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India.<br>
  Unlike other lingams that are made of stone or metal, people believe it to be a natural rock formation in the shape of a lingam.
